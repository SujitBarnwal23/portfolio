üéØ Design Vision
Theme: Classy, sleek, futuristic with aurora backgrounds, glowing gradients, subtle 3D effects
Feel: Professional credibility balanced with modern 3D visuals
Transitions: Smooth page transitions (Framer Motion style)
Hierarchy: Recruiter-friendly but visually striking
Interactive Elements: 3D visuals and elements

Aim:
I am planning to build my portfolio as I am a senior AI engineer with the backend knowledge and few about frontend as well. The portfolio will have AI Chat assistant in the Hero Section.
For now, we can have a 2Layered into the Hero Section so that in the second grid I can do mostly the AI related stuffs that I want to do.
Use a glassmorphism + gradient + dark/light toggle theme with 3D React Three Fiber visuals, smooth animations, and modern typography. The site should be designed for desktop-first with responsive mobile layouts.

Also for the Portfolio techstack that I have choosen is:
##Frontend (UI & Interactivity)
#Framework: Next.js 15 (with React Server Components App Router ‚Üí modern, fast, SEO-friendly)
#Styling: TailwindCSS + Framer Motion (for animations & sleek interactions) + shadcn/ui (for modern, sleek UI)
#UI Library: shadcn/ui (super trending right now for polished UI components)
#3D/Visuals: Three.js or R3F (React Three Fiber)  3D effects in hero sections + Drei (helpers) + GSAP (for hero animations)
AI Layer: LangChain + Gemini API (can start with local resume.json JSON)

Also, the color theme that I have decided for now are:
- Primary Dark / Background / Headers: #111827
- Secondary Neutral / Background Sections: #F5F5F5
- Text Neutral / Secondary Elements: #2A3138 
- Primary Brand Color: #4A90E2 ‚Üí Trust, tech, buttons, links
- Secondary Brand Color: #7D5BA6 ‚Üí Sophisticated purple, AI/futuristic touch
- Highlight 1: #FEE440 ‚Üí Yellow, sparingly for CTAs & hover states
- Highlight 2: #F15BB5 ‚Üí Creative pink accent for micro-details
- Highlight 3: #E74C3C ‚Üí Vermilion red for urgency / accent grabs

üîπ Site Requirements
Desktop-first responsive layout, mobile-optimized.
Smooth transitions (Framer Motion or Tailwind transitions).
Glassmorphism + gradient accents for cards, modals, and chat panel.
3D only for Hero Orb and Chat background visuals and About Me.
Use Gemini API for AI Chat (API key included).
Structure: /src/app with routes for each section; /components for reusable UI.
State management with Zustand for chat open/close.

AI/Smart Features (to stand out)
Add an AI-powered chatbot/assistant about your portfolio using:
LangChain + Gemini API + resume.json + prompt for enhancing the RAG from the JSON(resume.json)
curl:
curl --location 'https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-2.5-pro:generateContent' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'X-goog-api-key: AIzaSyCaCu-9OPiDghi1NxxcHnJYJU2bb9Xv0oE' \

      {
        "parts": [
          {
            "text": "Explain how AI works in a few words"
          }
        ]
      }

Could make it answer Qs like: ‚ÄúWhat projects has Sujit built in AI/Full Stack?‚Äù
AI-enhanced search for projects (semantic search from resume.json to format the answer, and also give the prompt along with Query to AI for enhancing the output quality.)
AI Features (My USP)
üîπ RAG-powered AI Chat
Knowledge Base: Your detailed resume + project docs embedded in vector DB
Chat: Conversational UI that doesn‚Äôt look like Slack ‚Äî think:
Floating assistant with animated avatar (3D or Lottie)
Contextual responses (‚ÄúAsk me about Sujit‚Äôs AI projects, Skills, or Experience)
UI Upgrade: Instead of simple text messages ‚Üí include cards, images, project previews, and links in responses.
Fallback for AI: Use gemini 2.5 Pro as primary model and use 2.5 flash model as the fallback but make sure the Response from the AI is not very verbose, and it should also be able to handle questions like "What is the total experience in AWS?" and respond with correct answer saying "2years in AWS and further explaining where and how AWS is used"


Portfolio Ideas with This Stack
Interactive Resume ‚Üí looks like an app, not just static text.
AI Chatbot Guide ‚Üí visitors can ‚Äúchat‚Äù with your resume/projects.
Dark/Light Mode + Sleek/Cool UI ‚Üí very modern.

3D & Visual Enhancements
To make it wow-factor classy:
Hero Section (Landing)
Your name/logo floating in 3D space with particles orbiting (R3F + Drei + shader effects)
Subtle parallax scroll effect
Animated tagline with gradient glow

Projects Section
Instead of plain grids ‚Üí 3D rotating cards or a carousel with tilt effects
Each card opens with a glassmorphism modal that contains project details, code links, and maybe a mini-demo

AI Chat Assistant
Can appear as a 3D hologram/avatar in the 2nd Grid Layout in the Hero Section (React Three Fiber model)
When speaking, the avatar‚Äôs mouth animates (sync with speech synthesis)
Alternate idea: A liquid/glass orb assistant that pulses with AI activity
üîπ Chat Section (Text-to-Text First, Modern UI)

Instead of classic ‚Äúchat bubbles‚Äù:
3D Orb Assistant
A floating, glowing orb in bottom-right.
Orb reacts (pulsates, changes colors, emits particles) when thinking/responding.
Chat opens as a sleek side panel with glassmorphism background and animation of unfolding from the ORB, not a plain window in the Hero Section with z-index in the second grid layout.

Message UI Upgrade
Instead of plain text ‚Üí AI responses can include:
Cards with project previews
Clickable tags (‚ÄúTell me about AI Projects‚Äù, ‚ÄúShow me Full-Stack Work‚Äù)
Animated typing indicators (start with basic ‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Äù in animating).
3D Chat Context
Background could have subtle animated waves/particles behind the chat panel. THe chat panel should have enough blurr to not mixup with other UI elements in the background.
User messages could ‚Äúfloat up‚Äù as glowing chips, AI messages ‚Äúslide in‚Äù as expanding hologram-like cards.
Background
Dynamic particle system or gradient waves (R3F shaders)
Aurora-like effect for classy vibes

Development Strategy
Scaffold with Next.js + Tailwind + shadcn/ui
Add Framer Motion transitions ‚Üí polish navigation
Integrate R3F for hero visuals ‚Üí keep performance in check (optimize with drei helpers + lazy loading)
Build AI chat as a standalone component ‚Üí text ‚Üí avatar integration
Incrementally enhance with 3D visuals Elements and 3D avatar
